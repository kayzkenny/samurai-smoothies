## samurai-smoothies
Hi Everyone! This project is a fork of the ninja smoothies project from thenetninja's Vue.Js and Firebase course on Udemy. Since the course doesn't dive into cloud storage at all.  I jsut added a cloud storage feature for adding images to the smoothies and also made some UX changes as well. Hope you find it informative

# Would you guys like to see a vuetify  version of this as well?
